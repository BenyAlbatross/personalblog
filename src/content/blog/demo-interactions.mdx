Welcome to this digital garden demo. This post tests the custom **Interaction Design System**.

## 1. External Hyperlinks
Standard links to external sites should show an arrow icon and open in a new tab.
Check out [Google](https://google.com) or the [Astro Documentation](https://docs.astro.build).

## 2. Smart Citations
We reference academic papers like *Attention Is All You Need* <Cite id="vaswani2017attention" client:visible /> which introduced the Transformer model.
Another classic is Tufte's work on visualization <Cite id="tufte2001visual" client:visible />.

Hover over the citations to see details.

## 3. Glossary Terms
We often use terms like <Glossary term="llm" client:visible>Large Language Models</Glossary> or <Glossary term="mdx" client:visible /> without explaining them inline.
Hover (or tap) to see the definition.

## 4. Side Notes
Here is a paragraph with a side note. <SideNote client:visible>This is a **side note**. It contains *rich text*, [links](https://example.com), and explains the context further. On desktop, it appears as a popover. On mobile, it expands inline (Tufte-style).</SideNote> This text continues after the side note marker.

## 5. Mathematical Equations
We can also render mathematical equations using **LaTeX**.
For example, the mass-energy equivalence is:

$$
E = mc^2
$$

Or inline equations like this: $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.

## Conclusion
This system allows for a "Clean Futurist" reading experience.

## UI Debugging

### Code Block Rendering
```typescript
interface Props {
  term: string;
  definition: string;
}

function TestComponent({ term }: Props) {
  return <div>{term}</div>;
}
```
### Image Rendering
<figure>
    <img 
        src="/Two-layer_feedforward_artificial_neural_network.png" 
        alt="Two-layer feedforward artificial neural network" 
    />
    <figcaption>
        Figure 1: Two-layer feedforward artificial neural network.
    </figcaption>
</figure>

This is a paragraph of text immediately following the image and caption. We are using this to check if there is excessive spacing between the media element and the flow of the article text. It should look comfortable but not disconnected.
